# Array Problems
# Using your idea sketches, pseudocode, or whiteboard code 
# from the brainstorming session, type it in your code editor, 
# run some test cases, and debug your code so it works correctly. 
# Implement at least 2 different solutions for each of the 3 
# problems above (6+ solutions total).

## Problem 1
# Given an array a of n numbers and a target value t, find two numbers whose sum is t.
# Example: a=[5, 3, 6, 8, 2, 4, 7], t=10  ⇒  [3, 7] or [6, 4] or [8, 2]

## Problem 2
# Given an array a of n numbers and a count k find the k 
# largest values in the array a.
# Example: a=[5, 1, 3, 6, 8, 2, 4, 7], k=3  ⇒  [6, 8, 7]

## Problem 3
# Given two arrays a and b of numbers and a target value t, 
# find a number from each array whose sum is closest to t.
# Example: a=[9, 13, 1, 8, 12, 4, 0, 5],  b=[3, 17, 4, 14, 6],  
# t=20  ⇒  [13, 6] or [4, 17] or [5, 14]
